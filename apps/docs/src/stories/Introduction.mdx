# theo-kit

Welcome to theo-kit - a headless UI component library for React.

## What is a headless UI library?

A headless UI library provides all the logic, state management, and accessibility features
for common UI components without any styling. This gives you complete control over the
visual design while ensuring your components are accessible and functional.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install theo-kit
# or
pnpm add theo-kit
# or
yarn add theo-kit
```

## Philosophy

- **Accessible by default**: All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
- **Unstyled**: Bring your own styles with CSS, Tailwind, or any styling solution
- **Composable**: Build complex UIs from simple, focused components
- **TypeScript first**: Full type safety out of the box
